Feel free to modfiy any configuration as you like these configurations suites me best. If you feel I should update or add something don't hesitate opening an issue or pull request I will try to respond as quick as possible.

## `‚ùì` Why
I created it to simplify the process of setting up a customized Kali Linux environment. As a pentester, I've often found myself spending hours configuring and installing various tools and configurations from scratch. This script aims to automate that process, making it easy for users to get started with a fully functional and customized Kali Linux environment.
